NAME
    I18N::String - Delay I18N translation until a variable is stringified

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use I18N::String qw('_');

        I18N::String->localize_via( \&localize );

        my @Days = (
            _('Monday'),   _('Tuesday'),  _('Wednesday'),
            _('Thursday'), _('Friday'),   _('Saturday'),
            _('Sunday')
        );

        sub day_of_week {
            my $day = shift;
            return $Days[$day]
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes it is useful to store I18N'able strings in variables, but
    delay their translation until the point that they are actually used.
    I18N::String does this for you.

USAGE
  Importing
        use I18N::String;           # exports loc()
        use I18N::String 'foo'      # exports a func named foo()


        my $str = foo('String');

        print $str;                 # localized version of 'String'

  localize_via()
        I18N::String->localize_via( $coderef );

    You need to set this once, and it is global. This is the function that
    will be called when your variable is stringified, to return the
    localized version.
